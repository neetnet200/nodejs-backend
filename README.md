Express JS and Node JS
From: Programming with Mosh 

ðŸ™Œ  This is a repository about coding a Node JS backend

Node is an open source and cross platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside services. It is not a programming language or framework. But we can use it to build backend services also called API's, application programming interfaces. Node is for building highly scaleable, data-intensive and real-time backend services (apps).

ðŸ™Œ  Hey, Why Node? 

1) Since I've learnt JavaScript for the front end, it would be useful to learn it for the backend! Keeping it simple!
2) Easy to get started, great for prototyping and agile development
3) Superfast and highly scalable services
4) Used in production by Paypal, Uber, Netflix
5) JavaScript used everywhere
6) Cleaner and more consistent codebase
7) Large ecosystem of open source libraries
8) And I'm excited to learn it!!

ðŸ™Œ  Architecture of Node

What is a runtime environment? Well, every browser has a JavaScript engine to convert to machine code. In 2009 Ryan Dahl took Google's V8 engine (the fastest JavaScript engine) and embedded it inside a C++ program and called it Node. Similar to a browser, Node is a runtime enviroment with JavaScript code. The new modules give us capabilities not available inside browsers. Node is:

1) Non-blocking asynchonous architecture by default where a single thread will handle all requests with an event queue
2) Node is therefore ideal for building apps that require disc or network access
3) Do not use for CPU intensive apps

ðŸ™Œ  What is the Node module system all about?

Modules are small building blocks where we define variables / functions. This is to prevent the problem of same definition / different file inside the global scope via the window object. Every file is considered to be a module, creating a scope. Eg App.js is our main module / object.
